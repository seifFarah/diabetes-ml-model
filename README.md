# Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates the development and evaluation of a machine learning model for predicting diabetes based on various health-related features, such as glucose levels, BMI, and age. The goal of the model is to accurately classify individuals into those with and without diabetes, with a focus on improving healthcare outcomes through early detection.

The model is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes the steps for data loading, pre-processing, model training, evaluation, and performance analysis.

## Performance Summary
- **Overall Accuracy**: 72.08%
  - The model correctly classifies approximately 72% of the test cases, providing a strong baseline for further improvement.
- **Precision (No Diabetes)**: 0.79
- **Recall (No Diabetes)**: 0.77
- **Precision (Diabetes)**: 0.60
- **Recall (Diabetes)**: 0.64
- **F1-Score (No Diabetes)**: 0.78
- **F1-Score (Diabetes)**: 0.62

### Confusion Matrix:
- **True Positives (35)**: Correctly identified diabetes cases.
- **True Negatives (76)**: Correctly identified individuals without diabetes.
- **False Positives (23)**: Incorrectly predicted diabetes for non-diabetic individuals.
- **False Negatives (20)**: Missed diabetes cases by incorrectly predicting no diabetes.

## Areas for Improvement
While the model performs reasonably well, there are opportunities for enhancement, especially in predicting diabetes cases. Potential improvements include:
1. **Feature Engineering**: Explore creating more informative features or interactions (e.g., combining glucose levels with BMI or age) to better capture meaningful patterns.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like grid search or randomized search to fine-tune the modelâ€™s hyperparameters and improve performance.
3. **Data Expansion**: Include more data (if available) to help the model generalize better to new data.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on improving precision, recall, and F1-score for the diabetes class, where the model is currently underperforming.
